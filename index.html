<p>To try this out: <a href="http://bouncingchairs.net/entrotype">http://bouncingchairs.net/entrotype</a></p>

<p>This is a <em>static site</em>, so all data, including users, is kept in your browser.
I felt this was important, since so many typing tutors are out there to show
you a ton of ads and get information, potentially about your kids. This one
doesn't do that, and it's open source.</p>

<p>It is a simple, single-page web app that aids in teaching touch-typing. Among its basic characteristics are</p>

<ul>
<li>No server login required, no data leaves the client.</li>
<li>Can be downloaded and run locally.</li>
<li>Everything is plain old Javascript to aid in hacking and teaching the language, should that be of interest (with the exception of the internal navigation, which is AngularJS).</li>
<li>Statistics are kept on each key so that it's easy to find and test trouble spots.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can pull this repository and run it locally using serve.sh (on a Unix-style
machine, e.g., Mac or Linux). It requires Python to run the local server. I'm
open to patches that add simpler support under Windows.</p>

<p>To use, just start it up and navigate to the given URL.</p>

<p>Patches and issues are always welcome.</p>
